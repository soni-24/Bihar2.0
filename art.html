 About Bihar
  Bihar, located in the eastern part of India, is a land steeped in history, culture, and intellectual legacy. It is considered one of the oldest inhabited regions in the world, with a history that dates back more than 3,000 years. Bihar has played a pivotal role in shaping ancient Indian civilization and spiritual traditions.

      <h2>Madhubani Painting</h2>
      <p>
       Traditionally, Madhubani paintings were created as wall murals (Kohabar) and floor paintings (Aripana) in homes, depicting themes of love, fertility, devotion, and nature. They were drawn with natural colors sourced from plants, metals, and household ingredients, charcoal for black, turmeric for yellow, flowers for red, and leaves for green mixed with resin and gum for durability. The artists used fine bamboo twig brushes for detailing and cloth-wrapped twigs for filling spaces.      </p>

      <h2>Sujani Embroidery</h2>
      <p>
        In the quiet village of Bhusara, Bihar, women once gathered around old, worn-out sarees, their needles weaving stories of faith, life, and struggle. This was the birth of Sujani embroidery, an art form deeply rooted in tradition and storytelling. Stitched with crimson and yellow threads, red for blood and life, yellow for the sun, a piece was more than just fabric; it was a prayer, an offering to Chitiriya Maa, the ‘Lady of the Tatters’. The motifs spoke of ancient beliefs, serpents coiling beside fish, elephants marching through forests, and Rama’s grand wedding procession. Every stitch carried whispers of devotion, of generations of women passing down their silent narratives, their joys, and their sorrows.

      <h2>Bhagalpur Weaving</h2>
      <p>
       Bhagalpur, a major tussar silk weaving hub in Bihar, is known for its high-quality silk fabric, traditionally dyed in bright colors like red, blue, pink, and orange. The fabric is woven from the Antheraea mylitta silkworm, which feeds on local forest trees. Characterized by its textured surface with patterned stripes and checks, Bhagalpuri tussar silk is crafted by thousands of skilled artisans using traditional four-shaft pit looms, locally called khatkal.

      <h2>Stone Art</h2>
      <p>
       Recognizing the significance of this craft, the government of Bihar and various NGOs have stepped in to support the artisans through initiatives like the Vishwakarma Vikas Yojana and the Pattharkatti Craft Village. These programs provide training, resources, and opportunities to ensure that the legacy of Bihar’s stone craft not only survives but thrives in the modern era.
